# KeePass-SalsaCipher

Enables KeePass to encrypt databases using the Salsa20 cipher. Just download 
the Salsa20Cipher.plgx file and put it into the KeePass installation folder. 
KeePass should automatically recognize it as an available encryption algorithm. 

### Requirements

This plugin requires KeePass 2.09 or higher, and .NET framework 4.0 or higher. 
I have not yet tested it with lower .NET framework versions, but it's on my TODO 
list.
